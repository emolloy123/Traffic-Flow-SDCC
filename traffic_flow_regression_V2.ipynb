    "- That was a pretty easy addition of a feature. Whether it ends up being super predictive or not isn't what's important right now, but more the principle of how features can be created that may be useful from what is handed to us\n",
    "- One thing I noticed from the V1 notebook is the isolation of each site. I think it makes sense to have separate models for each site but we are then isolating a dataset of 40,000 samples into ~7000 per site.\n",
    "### 2. Traffic Flow at other junctions \n",
    "- Well as we saw in our EDA some of the sites are quite close together. So if one site has a lot of traffic flow surely that would predict that the other sites close to it would also have traffic flow as cars may be driving through different sites\n",
    "- To model this, let's create a feature for each sample that is the amount of traffic flow in all the sites in the <b> previous interval </b> to that sample.\n",
    " #### ** NB: Data Leakage **\n",
    "- Let's make up a use case for this model as that we are building a real time traffic control system for these sites\n",
    "- Here the model has already been trained and is being fed data live and every half an hour it predicts what the traffic flow is going to be for the next half an hour. Since one of our features is going to be traffic flow at other junctions, this will be fed too.\n",
    "- Obviously in this scenario **we do not have the traffic flow data for the other sites for that interval as it hasn't happened yet**.\n",
    "- Therefore the data we would have available to us that is useful is the traffic flow data from the previous interval\n",
    "- This may seem obvious but when building and training a model on historical data, it can become easy to just see the dataset as a bunch of numbers and forget where they are coming from in the real world\n",
    "- This is something that separates building a model for fun and learning about machine learning to actually putting a model out there in production that has use in the real world."
